## Overview
This is a freelance portfolio website that I built in order to test my ability to learn a frontend framework like bootstrap.  I got help from watching various tutorials and reading the bootstrap documentation to understand how the whole framework functions.
The projects goal was to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Get a better grasp of the use of a framework like bootstrap in styling sites.
- Live Site URL: [Freelance-Portfolio Website](https://seun-works.github.io/Freelance-portfolio-landing-page/)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Javascript
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap




### Continued development

My goal as a developer is to work on how well i use my tools and to get better at writing clean code in the nearest future.
